# Purli

Purli is a publishing platform that offers clean versions of books by filtering out profanity and explicit scenes, expanding an author's audience while preserving the integrity of their work.

## Overview

What We Do:
We work with authors and publishers to create "Purli Versions" of books—edits that remove explicit content without compromising the narrative flow.


## How It Works:

Partnerships: Authors and publishers grant permission for clean edits.
Editing Process: Expert editors (and future AI assistance) create a refined version of the text.
Distribution: Initially sold as eBooks directly from our website, with plans to expand distribution channels.
Why Purli?
It’s not about censorship—it's about choice. Authors can increase their audience and revenue, while readers enjoy literature tailored to their preferences.
